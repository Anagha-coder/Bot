# Bot
Automated Software 

A 'bot' – short for robot – is a software program that performs automated, repetitive, pre-defined tasks. Bots typically imitate or replace human user behavior.
Because they are automated, they operate much faster than human users.
Here created a Bot purely in Python. 


# Whatsapp.py 
- This program is built to automate whatsapp. 
- A python library called 'selenium' performs major role in this automation.
- To access this on Whatsapp's official website we've used  'Webdriver_manager.chrome' & 'ChromeDriverManager'. 




# Encourage.py 
- This program is to automate DISCORD SERVER.
- Due to pandemic everything is going virtual. So people are getting connected through these social platforms where they can learn, connect, explore globlly.
- Discord server has major role in this. So to automate its function like sending welcome messages, inspiring quotes, encouraging them, and so on. So a single person can't handle this. This is where automation comes in use.

import os
import discord
import requests #to request http response
import json #to get that responce
import random
from replit import db
from keep_alive import keep_alive

We've imported these python libraries, to get the work done.
